# UnixZipper

A simple compression package for Unix operating systems.

## Who does it work

## Why unix

The reason I chose to make this package unix only is because I wanted to rely
on the system's zip function, that offers stability and flexibility.

## Dependencies

There are no dependencies on other packages or classes.

## Installation

Even though you can just download and include the UnixZipper class, I would
recommend you to use composer, as it makes the update process much easier.

```php
$foo = 'bar';
```
